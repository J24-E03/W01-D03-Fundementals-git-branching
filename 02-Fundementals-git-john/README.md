You will be committing code as yourself and as John

## Steps

    1. Name
    2. Country of Origin
    3. Technologies
    4. Interesting thing happening right now
7. Push your code on to github and make a pull request to the dev branch
8. Merge your branch to the dev branch
9. Now locally change branches to johns branch
10. Lets say John takes it upon himself to make your introduction for you even though that isnt his responsibility
11. You can just use your introduction but just change some lines to simulate john messing up your data
12. Now push johns branch onto github
13. Merge the john branch into the dev branch
14. Resolve the conflicts and use your information not the information that john added for your introduction
